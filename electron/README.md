The app should do the following:
 - Retrieve email files from a specified S3 bucket
    and allow the user to view them
 - Allow the user to send a new email and specify the
    raw text and/or raw HTML to include in the email
 - Allow the user to send a new email and select from
    a list of prewritten HTML templates to use for the
    content of the email
 - Allow a user to send a bulk email message to multiple
    contacts
 - Allow a user to add new contacts manually
 - When a user views an email that was the result of a
    contact form submission, the app should give the user
    the option of creating a new contact automatically
    using the info in the contact form
 - Allow a user to delete a contact
